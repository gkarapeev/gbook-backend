## Done
✅ - Feed endpoint<br />
✅ - Comments on posts<br />
✅ - make possible to request posts by scrolling, aka from some index onwards, aka skip & take<br />
✅ - Make a get-user request that reutrns the full name and stuff by id. That will allow not fetching the entire registry just to load a profile.
✅ - get rid of repeated logic for including the comments in getFeed and GetPostsByUser<br />
