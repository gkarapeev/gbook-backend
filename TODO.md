## Features
ğŸ•™ - On createPost, return entire post with full user and stuff, so that we dont have to fetch all the posts again, just to display the last one with author name.

ğŸ•™ - implement 3-layered architecture<br />
ğŸ•™ - Migrate to Postgres<br />
ğŸ•™ - implement db migrations

## Security
ğŸ•™ - limit size of every single inputtable field in order to prevent flooding attacks<br />
ğŸ•™ - rate-limit per user to mitigate brute-force attacks<br />
ğŸ•™ - two-factor auth for user security and to obstruct fake profile creation<br />
ğŸ•™ - CAPTCHA to obstruct fake profile creation
